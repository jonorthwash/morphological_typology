<h2>What is this?</h2>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

You will be presented with the following graph, there will be two axes: Analytic&mdash;Synthetic
and Fusional&mdash;Agglutinative.

The Analytic&mdash;Synthetic axis relates to the number of morphs (or morphemes) per token, you may define
token as you see fit, as word or as construct(ion), but the unit should be comparable for the 
languages you choose.

The Fusional&mdash;Agglutinative axis relates to the number of "meanings" per morph (or morpheme).

Examples:

Klingon, Quenya and Valyrian.

<h2>What will be done with the data?</h2>


<h2> Frequently asked questions </h2>

<h3> How well should I know the language? </h3>

If you would feel comfortable standing up in front of your peers and making that classification 
then feel free to add it. If you only know about it through hearsay then please do not.


<h3> If everyone can define token differently how will this data be useful? </h3>

At this stage of our research, we are particularly interested in the perceptions and variance in 
those perceptions in how people quantify morphological complexity. We are interested to see 
what people's perceptions are, and how much they vary per language. 

For example, some languages may have a very low level of variance, people generally agree where
they fall on the graph, but others may have a high level of variance. This is the kind of 
information we are interested in collecting.
