<h2>What is this?</h2>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

You will be presented with the following graph, there will be two axes: Analytic&mdash;Synthetic
and Fusional&mdash;Agglutinative.

The Analytic&mdash;Synthetic axis relates to the number of morphs (or morphemes) per token, you may define
token as you see fit, as word or as construction, but the unit should be comparable for the 
languages you choose.

The Fusional&mdash;Agglutinative axis relates to the number of "meanings" per morph (or morpheme).

Examples:

Klingon, Quenya and Valyrian.
